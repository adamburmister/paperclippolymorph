h1. PaperclipPolymorph


This plugin allows users of the Paperclip plugin to easily share attached files between 
multiple models. Essentially, polymorphic paperclip transparently saves the attached files
into a separate asset's table and associates the the model to the asset through a polymorphic
_attachings_ table.

The Paperclip Plugin must also be installed for PolyMorphicPaperclip to work.

h3. Example

class PhotoEssay < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_polymorphic_paperclip
end

You can also add a counter_cache to your model if you wish.
class Essay < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_polymorphic_paperclip :counter_cache => true
end

@essay.assets.attach(@asset)
@essay.assets.detach -or- @essay.assets.detach(@asset)

h4. Helper methods
There is one helper method so far used to determine if the asset can be displayed in a browser
@essay.assets.first.browser_safe? # => returns true or false
