PaperclipPolymorph
==========================

This plugin allows users of the Paperclip plugin to easily share attached files between 
multiple models. Essentially, polymorphic paperclip transparently saves the attached files
into a separate asset's table and associates the the model to the asset through a polymorphic
_attachings_ table.

The Paperclip Plugin must also be installed for PolyMorphicPaperclip to work.
